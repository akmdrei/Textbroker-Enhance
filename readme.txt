This plugin evaluates a hook in the modified Textbroker Wordpress plugin (http://akmdrei.github.com/Textbroker-Wordpress-Plugin-Plus/) to automatically highlight the SEO-keywords as bold and push them to All-in-One SEO post_meta entry 

== Description ==

It adds filters to the modified Textbroker wordpress plugin (http://akmdrei.github.com/Textbroker-Wordpress-Plugin-Plus/).

Note that the normal plugin from Textbroker does not support hooks, so you first need to install the modified version.

These filters are:

1. Enhance all SEO-Keywords from Textbroker with the HTML bold tag <b>

2. If you are using the All-In-One-SEO-Pack http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/ all SEO-Keywords from Textbroker
will automatically be added to the HTML-Keywords field of All-In-One-SEO-Pack


This plugin is Multi-Site compatible!

== Installation ==
